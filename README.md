## Project Objective
The objective of this capstone project is to apply the knowledge and skills acquired during the SE Bootcamp by building a full-stack MERN application. This project showcases my proficiency in developing both the frontend and backend components of a web application, adhering to best practices, and utilizing modern development tools.

## Technologies Used
1. **MongoDB**: For database management and storing application data.
2. **Express.js**: Backend framework used for building the RESTful API.
3. **React.js**: Frontend framework for creating a dynamic user interface.
4. **Node.js**: Runtime environment for server-side code.
5. **Axios/Fetch API**: For data fetching from the server.
6. **CSS**: Styling the frontend for a clean, user-friendly interface. 

## Features
1. **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in, with protected routes based on authentication.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Complete set of Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities.
3. **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
4. **API Integration**: Interfaces with a custom-built RESTful API for data handling.
5. **React Router**: Provides navigation and routing between different pages of the application.
6. **State Management**: Uses React Hooks for state management.

## API Endpoints
- GET /api/items: Fetch all items.
- POST /api/items: Add a new item.
- PUT /api/items/: Update an item by ID.
- DELETE /api/items/: Delete an item by ID.
- POST /api/users/login: User login.
- POST /api/users/register: User registration.

## Challenges and Solutions
1. **Challenge 1**: Handling Authentication
- Solution: Implemented JWT-based authentication to secure routes and ensure user sessions are managed properly.

2. **Challenge 2**: Error Handling
- Solution: Used try/catch blocks and error handlers in both the frontend and backend to gracefully manage exceptions.

3. **Challenge 3**: Asynchronous Data Fetching
- Solution: Implemented async/await with Axios to handle API requests more efficiently. 


## Future Enhancements
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement different access levels based on user roles.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Integrate WebSocket or another real-time technology to notify users of updates.
- **Performance Optimization**: Explore lazy loading and code splitting for better performance.
- **Backend Menu**: Implement a menu in the backend to maintain the product items.
